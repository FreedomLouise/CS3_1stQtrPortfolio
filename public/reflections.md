# End of Quarter Reflection
## AGUINALDO, Freedom Louise M. | 9 - Cesium

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
    ╰┈➤ Conditional Operators (If-Else Statements)
            ↳ Similar to C++, the if-else statement was already discussed back in Grade 8. I've worked with this statement everytime because it's the easiest to understand than the switch statements.

    ╰┈➤ Arithmetic Operators
            ↳ It was already discussed in Grade 8 and it is also similar to C++. I recieved enough coding tasks to learn this since I use it almost everytime.

    ╰┈➤ Variable Declaration 
            ↳ It was already introduced last year in Grade 8 by using C++. It's also really easy to use since it's just declaring variables in their respective block. 

    ╰┈➤ Number Properties
            ↳ It's easy to understand due to their names. It's also easy to use in graded exercises and Long Tests.

    ╰┈➤ Logical Operators
            ↳ It's already been learned in Grade 8. It's also easy to memorize, understand, and to use.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
    ╰┈➤ Conditional Operators (Loop Statements)
            ↳ Although it was already taught last year in Grade 8, I sometimes forget how they work. For example, the while loop and do-while loop. It's familiar but not that familiar.

    ╰┈➤ Declaring Functions (Custom = Function as an Expression)
            ↳ It's easy to learn it, but memorizing how to do it is not. I used it once in a class activity and never again.

    ╰┈➤ VS Code
            ↳ It's easy to use but I have troubles using it sometimes. For example, I had trouble making codes using my VS Code in laptop.

    ╰┈➤ Debugging
            ↳ I find it more hard to debug than doing the code itself. Some of the codes in debugging looks alright but actually not. Some of those remain unchanged because I don't remember their formula.

    ╰┈➤ Number Methods
            ↳ It's just been recently discussed and there are some stuff that I can't memorize. For example, the formula of the randomizing math one.

## 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
    ╰┈➤ My plan on understanding the topics I learned more is to apply them more in coding. I would search coding problems like what we do in graded exercises and that one debugging problem to expand and get used to them. 

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
    ╰┈➤  In the activities that were done in class, the most helpful ones are the ones in Kahoot and speed test. For me, the competitive side of me can learn better when I made a mistake like in Kahoot so I would keep it in my mind to never do that mistake again. The two less effectives ones are the debugging and also the speed test. Speed tests are sometimes helpfuil but it's kind of discouraging whenever someone in the table already got it when I'm still doing the code. Debugging part, I just don't understand much.
